4. **Clear Log File**:
    - This option clears the `app.log` file.

5. **Open Log File**:
    - This option opens the `app.log` file to view the log entries.

### Backtesting

Backtesting is a crucial feature of the Wavy Tunnel Trading Bot. It allows you to simulate trading strategies on historical data to evaluate their performance before applying them to live trading. Hereâ€™s an end-to-end breakdown of what happens when the backtest is run:

1. **Initialization**:
    - The backtesting function initializes the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform using the credentials and path provided in the configuration.

2. **Data Retrieval**:
    - Historical data for the specified symbols and timeframe is retrieved from the MT5 platform. This data includes open, high, low, close prices, and volumes.
    - **Dates for Historical Data**:
        - The start and end dates for the historical data are currently set in the `main.py` file within the `run_backtest_func` function:
        ```python
        start_date = datetime(2024, 6, 12)
        end_date = datetime.now()
        ```
        - `start_date` is set to June 12, 2024.
        - `end_date` is set to the current date and time when the backtest is run.

3. **Strategy Execution**:
    - **Calculate Indicators**:
        - The strategy calculates the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for different periods (e.g., 50-period EMA, 200-period EMA) using the historical price data.
    - **Detect Peaks and Dips**:
        - The strategy identifies peaks and dips in the price data based on certain conditions, such as price crossing above or below the EMA.
    - **Check Entry Conditions**:
        - The strategy checks for entry conditions. For example, a typical entry condition might be:
            - A buy signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA, indicating a potential upward trend.
            - A sell signal is generated when the short-term EMA crosses below the long-term EMA, indicating a potential downward trend.
    - **Execute Trades**:
        - When the entry conditions are met, a virtual trade is opened with the specified parameters such as stop loss and take profit.
        - The strategy manages the trade, monitoring the price movements and checking for exit conditions.
    - **Check Exit Conditions**:
        - The strategy checks for exit conditions, such as reaching the take profit level, hitting the stop loss, or reversing signals (e.g., EMA crossover in the opposite direction).

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
    - Throughout the backtesting period, the strategy logs each trade, including entry and exit points, profit and loss, and other relevant metrics.
    - After the backtesting period, the overall performance is evaluated based on metrics such as total profit, number of trades, win rate, maximum drawdown, and risk-reward ratio.

5. **Logging and Results**:
    - All activities and results during the backtest are logged in the `app.log` file.
    - Upon completion, you can view the logs and evaluate the performance of the trading strategy.
