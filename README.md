    This remains your entry point. It should handle initializing and starting your trading application.
    Initialization of the trading environment (Mt5 object) and starting the strategy should remain here.

3. config.py

    This should include the Config class which loads and manages configurations from the .env file.
    The contents of config/__init__.py can be moved here, refactored to fit a more streamlined approach for handling environment variables and possibly other configurations.

4. scheduler.py

    Manage scheduling logic for trading strategies.
    Move the scheduling parts from main.py and tunnel/strategy.py that handle timing and intervals of trading strategy execution.

5. metatrader/connection.py

    Manage all connectivity with the MetaTrader 5 API.
    Functions related to connection and initialization from metatrader/mt5_lib.py like connect() should be moved here.

6. metatrader/trade_management.py

    Focus on managing trades, including opening, closing, and modifying trades.
    Include methods from metatrader/mt5_lib.py like send_order(), close_open_positions(), cancel_order(), and cancel_all_orders().

7. metatrader/data_retrieval.py

    Responsible for retrieving market data from MetaTrader 5.
    Move data fetching functionalities from metatrader/mt5_lib.py such as get_open_positions(), get_balance_and_equity(), get_orders_history(), and get_candlesticks().

8. metatrader/indicators.py

    Contains all logic for calculating trading indicators.
    Functions from metatrader/_helper.py like calculate_rsi(), calculate_sma(), calculate_ema(), and other helper functions related to trading indicators should be moved here.

9. strategy/tunnel_strategy.py

    Implements the specific logic for the tunnel trading strategy.
    Move and adapt relevant parts from tunnel/strategy.py, particularly those parts that deal directly with the tunnel strategy specifics.

    General trade decision logic that can be reused across different strategies.
    Move reusable trading logic portions from tunnel/strategy.py that are not specific to the tunnel strategy.

    Provides logging functionality across the application.
    Implement logging across all files for error tracking and operational information.

12. utils/types.py

    Defines and manages custom data types used across the application.
    The NamedTuple classes from utils/types.py should be maintained here.

13. utils/error_handling.py

    Centralizes error management logic.
    Handle exceptions and errors uniformly across your application.

14. utils/data_validation.py

    Ensures data integrity and validation across the application.
    Implement functions to validate data inputs and outputs across different modules.

15. tests/

    This directory will include all unit and integration tests for the application.
    Each component of the application like connection, indicators, trade management, and strategies should have corresponding test files.

16. README.md

    Provides documentation on setup, configuration, and usage.
    Should be detailed to assist new users or developers in setting up and using the system.
