Set up the environment:

Install Jupyter Notebook if you haven't already.
Create a new Jupyter Notebook file.


Import required libraries:

We'll need to import libraries such as numpy, pandas, and talib (for technical indicators).
Install the necessary libraries using pip or conda.


Load and preprocess data:

Load the historical price data into a pandas DataFrame.
Ensure that the data includes the necessary columns: date, open, high, low, close, and volume.
Preprocess the data as needed (e.g., handle missing values, convert data types).


Implement the Wavy Tunnel:

Calculate the EMAs for the wavy tunnel using the talib library or custom functions.
Store the calculated EMAs in separate columns of the DataFrame.


Implement user inputs:

Define variables for user inputs such as RSI filter, ATR filter, threshold values, etc.
Use input prompts or predefined values to set these variables.


Implement trend analysis:

Calculate the long-term EMA and RSI using the talib library or custom functions.
Store the results in separate columns of the DataFrame.


Implement peak and dip detection:

Write functions to detect peaks and dips based on the specified peak type.
Store the detected peaks and dips in separate lists or arrays.


Implement liquidation levels:

Write functions to find the last peak and dip that meet the specified criteria.
Store the liquidation levels in separate variables.


Implement entry conditions:

Write functions to evaluate the entry conditions based on the wavy tunnel, trend direction, RSI levels, and ATR values.
Store the entry signals in separate columns of the DataFrame.


Implement support and resistance proximity:

Calculate the support and resistance levels based on the specified logic.
Store the support and resistance levels in separate columns of the DataFrame.


Implement position management:

Write functions to manage positions, including entering, exiting, and updating positions.
Store the position details (entry price, quantity, etc.) in separate variables or a dedicated class.


Implement the second strategy:

Write functions to evaluate the entry conditions for the second strategy.
Manage positions for the second strategy separately from the main strategy.


Implement backtesting:

Write a backtesting function that iterates through the DataFrame and simulates trades based on the entry and exit signals.
Keep track of the portfolio value, trades, and performance metrics.


Visualize the results:

Use plotting libraries like matplotlib or plotly to visualize the price data, indicators, entry/exit points, and performance metrics.


Optimize and refine:

Analyze the backtesting results and identify areas for improvement.
Fine-tune the strategy parameters and logic based on the insights gained from backtesting.
